 ME_Daimyo_Events.1.d: "The crippling lack of heir for the position of the Shogun has lead the current titleholder, [ASK.Monarch.GetTitle] [ASK.Monarch.GetName], to have convinced his younger brother Ashikaga Yoshimi, who was leading a life of a monk at the time of the request, to abandon his current lifestyle and become his heir. A year later, the wife of the Shogun has given birth to a male heir, whose claim is being supported by the influential Seishitsu. [HSK.Monarch.GetName], having been a long friend of Yoshimi, is leading a considerable campaign against their arch-nemesis, Yamana clan, who are in support of the young child.
