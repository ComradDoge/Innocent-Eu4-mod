 # Missions:
 corsica_seek_support_from_aboard_title: "Seek Support From Abroad"
 corsica_seek_support_from_aboard_desc: "Our island is incapable of rebelling against the mighty Genoese Republic on its own. For years we have tried and failed, and it is time for a new strategy. Genoa's rivals are many, and we ought to exploit every diplomatic weak point they have so we can finally be free once again!"
 corsica_develop_the_island_title: "Develop the Island"
 corsica_develop_the_island_desc: "Corsica is not yet independent, and this is partially due to the rural status of the island. It is a patchwork of farms and small towns, unable to field any sort of worthwhile army. We must develop the land to its full potential - only then can we raise a proper defense."
 corsica_genoese_piracy_title: "Genoese Piracy"
 corsica_genoese_piracy_desc: "The Genoese make the majority of their money from trade, but what happens when their trade is cut off by pirates? It's an interesting thought, to say the least. We are in a perfect position to strong arm the trade going into Genoa and make piles of ducats off of piracy!"
 corsica_war_for_independence_title: "War for Independences"
 corsica_war_for_independence_desc: "The time has finally come to break the Genoese chains and restore honor to the Corsican people! Corsica must fight vigorously with her allies - or die trying."
 corsica_piracy_in_corsica_title: "Piracy in Corsica?"
 corsica_piracy_in_corsica_desc: "Resentment for foreign traders has boiled to an all time high in the Corsican streets. The Aragonese and Genoese have destroyed Corsican ways of life with their lust for wealth! Some of our advisors suggest we take a proactive stance towards the traders - piracy. For all these years under foreign domination, one must admit that the revenge would be satisfying."
 corsica_bolster_the_confederacy_title: "Bolster the Confederacy"
 corsica_bolster_the_confederacy_desc: "We are a relatively new republic, and other nations look at us with an air of contempt. We need to ensure our republican traditions remain strong and that we maintain dominance in the seas."
 corsica_corsican_infrastructure_title: "Corsican Infrastructure"
 corsica_corsican_infrastructure_desc: "Corsica has been sufficiently developed, but its cities lack essential infrastructure. Many nearby ports have essential buildings such as churches, docks, and markets. We ought to catch up with the times and develop our cities to match them."
 corsica_attack_on_majorca_title: "Attack on Majorca"
 corsica_attack_on_majorca_desc: "Now the Aragonese will know how we felt when they tried to invade our homeland! Majorca brings us ever closer to Valencia itself, and so is an essential naval base for us to expand into. Soon, our enemies will be vanquished!"
 corsica_independent_corsica_title: "Independent Corsica"
 corsica_independent_corsica_desc: "Now we are free from foreign domination and ready to achieve new found glory! However, there are many vendettas to be settled. The Genoese and Aragonese have fought over the island like vultures circling over their prey. Many suggest that we wait for an opportunity to strike and take their island territories, but some suggest an even more radical solution - piracy."
 corsica_seize_sardinia_title: "Seize Sardinia"
 corsica_seize_sardinia_desc: "Sardinia is our neighbor island and its inhabitants are brothers to us in culture. Unfortunately, it is plagued with Aragonese garrisons. We should free them - further establishing our control over the Mediterranean Sea!"
 corsica_a_sea_of_pirates_title: "A Sea of Pirates"
 corsica_a_sea_of_pirates_desc: "Our pirates have managed to capture from Majorca to Messina, and we have no intention of stopping. We will ensure all trade in the Mediterranean comes under our grasp, and our privateers shall rule as masters over the seas!"
 corsica_promote_the_renaissance_title: "Promote the Renaissance"
 corsica_promote_the_renaissance_desc: "The Italian Renaissance is in full swing, and as Italians ourselves, we simply must participate! Not only will it boost our progress in science, but we will benefit greatly from the new studies of philosophy and the classics!"
 corsica_capture_of_sicily_title: "Capture of Sicily"
 corsica_capture_of_sicily_desc: "Sicily is within our grasp. Securing this ancient island will grant us undeniable power over the trade that flows through the Mediterranean Sea, but we will have to fight with valor if we are to seize the island. Keep your heads up and backs straight, men! We sail onward!"
