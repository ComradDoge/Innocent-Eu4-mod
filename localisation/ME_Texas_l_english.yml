 ME_Texas_Events.1.t: "The Wild Frontier"
 ME_Texas_Events.1.d: "From cowboys to caudillos, the Wild West has it all. Life certainly isn't easy on the frontier, which has given rise to a unique culture and lifestyle focused on herding open-range cattle and horses. Though charming, this way of life is difficult and rowdy, making it very difficult to establish government control over these people without the proper infrastructure."
 ME_Texas_Events.1.a: "Such if life, I reckon."
